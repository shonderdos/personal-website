## Hi, I’m Serge Honderdos.

A senior software engineer with 10 years of experience in developing enterprise applications for [KLM](http://www.klm.nl/en), [Schiphol](https://www.schiphol.nl/en), [Backbase](https://www.backbase.com), [Athlon](https://www.athlon.com), and [NS](https://www.ns.nl/en) working as a consultant at [Sytac](https://sytac.io/).

I have hands-on experience working on several projects that use JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js. I'm not afraid of hard work and always keen on accepting new challenges. Based on my experience, I prefer an Angular and Node.js environment, but I'm familiar with the entire JavaScript stack.
